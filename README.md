# SgrA_Interpolation
Asynchronous time series interpolation of Sagittarius A* multi-wavelength data using machine learning. All the code/data for training/inferencing each model can be found in their respective directories: GPyTorch, Tripletformer, Diffusion

Main analysis scripts can be found in the Analysis directory.

Benchmarking done with multi-output Gaussian Processes (MOGPs) and Tripletformer in their respective directories.
