# SgrA_Interpolation
Probabilistic Interpolation of Sagittarius A*'s Multi-Wavelength Light Curves Using Diffusion Models. All the code/data for training/inferencing each model can be found in their respective directories: GPyTorch, Tripletformer, Diffusion

Benchmarking done with multi-output Gaussian Processes (MOGPs) and Tripletformer in their respective directories.
