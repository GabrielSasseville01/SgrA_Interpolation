# SgrA_Interpolation
Asynchronous time series interpolation of Sagittarius A* multi-wavelength data using machine learning. Pre-trained model and scripts for training/inferencing can be found in directory Tripletformer

Benchmarking done with multi-output Gaussian Processes (MOGPs) and Tripletformer in their respective directories.
TACTiS-2 adapted to include time series specific inductive biases.

Project still in the works. Part of future paper Sasseville et al. 2025
